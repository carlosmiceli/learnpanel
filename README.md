## Description

This an idea for a project that I came up with after being frustrated with frequent online distractions and time-sinks, usually because of different platforms' algorithms and design (e.g.: Youtube). This app (currently a prototype) is a personalized learning environment where you can drop long content to watch/read directly from your dashboard, and take/save notes in real time. Notes are connected to each piece of content, and session persists in a way that you can pick your learning right back up where you left it every time you open the page.

## Status

Prototype is finished, feel free to sign up and test its features, or download/review the code.
Main goal was to expand my portfolio and push myself to code/learn new stuff.
Server is hosted on Heroku: https://learn-panel-api.herokuapp.com/, plus set up a Cron Job to ping the server every 30 mins. and keep Heroku's dyno running.
Client is hosted on Netlify: https://flamboyant-euler-94f8f7.netlify.app/
